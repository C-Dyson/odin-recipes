    <h4>The Essentials:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Freshly roasted coffee beans (choose your favourite!)</li>
      <li>Coffee grinder (burr grinder recommended for consistent grind)</li>
      <li>Coffee brewing device (French press, pour-over, AeroPress, etc.)</li>
      <li>Filtered water (heated to the appropriate temperature for your brewing method)</li>
      <li>Scale (optional, but highly recommended for accuracy)</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>Step-by-Step:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Grind your beans:</strong> Grind your coffee beans just before brewing for optimal freshness. Use a grind size suitable for your chosen brewing method. (Finer grind for espresso, coarser for French press)</li>
      <li><strong>Prepare your device:</strong> Preheat your brewing device and filter according to the manufacturer's instructions. This helps ensure even extraction and prevents heat loss.</li>
      <li><strong>Measure and dose:</strong> Use a scale to measure your coffee and water accurately. A good starting point is a 1:16 coffee-to-water ratio (e.g., 15g coffee for 240ml water). Adjust based on your taste and brewing method.</li>
      <li><strong>Bloom the coffee:</strong> Pour a small amount of hot water over the grounds, just enough to saturate them. Let it sit for 30 seconds to release CO2 and ensure even extraction.</li>
      <li><strong>Slowly pour the remaining water:</strong> Use a slow, steady pour to evenly extract the coffee's flavours. Aim for a consistent flow and avoid pouring directly on the filter.</li>
      <li><strong>Let it brew:</strong> Steep the coffee for the recommended time based on your brewing method. Don't over-extract, as it can lead to bitterness.</li>
      <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong> Serve your coffee immediately and savour the aroma and flavour. Experiment with different beans, grind sizes, and ratios to find your perfect cup.</li>
    </ol>
  
    <h4>Tips for the Coffee Connoisseur:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Store your coffee beans in an airtight container away from light and heat.</li>
      <li>Experiment with different water temperatures. Generally, hotter water extracts more flavour, but can also lead to bitterness. Start cooler and adjust if needed.</li>
      <li>Cleaning your brewing equipment regularly ensures optimal flavor and prevents build-up.</li>
      <li>Explore different brewing methods to discover new flavour profiles and experiences.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, have fun and enjoy your coffee journey!</li>
    </ul>
