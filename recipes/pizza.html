    </ul>

    <h3>Step-by-step</h3>
    <h4>Start the Dough</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Feed your starter: 8-12 hours before making the pizza, feed your sourdough starter with equal parts flour and water (approx. 50g each). Leave it at room temperature to become bubbly and active.</li>
        <li>Mix the dough: In a large bowl, combine the white bread flour, salt, and active sourdough starter. Gradually add the luke-warm water and olive oil, mixing until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough: Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Add more flour as needed to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Bulk fermentation: Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover with a damp tea towel, and leave to rise at room temperature for 4-6 hours, performing stretch and folds every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours. (Stretch and fold: gently stretch the dough outwards, fold it over itself, and rotate the bowl. Repeat 4-5 times.)</li>
        <li>Shaping: After bulk fermentation, gently deflate the dough and shape it into a tight ball on a lightly floured surface. Place it seam-side down in a floured banneton (basket) or bowl, cover, and refrigerate for at least 12 hours (up to 36 hours).</li>
    </ol>


    <h4>Get the sauce going</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Simmer the sauce: In a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped tomatoes, oregano, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Assembly and Baking:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven and prepare: At least 30 minutes before baking, preheat your oven to its highest setting (ideally 240Â°C or higher). If using a baking stone, place it on the bottom rack to preheat. Otherwise, preheat a baking tray.</li>
        <li>Stretch the dough: On a lightly floured surface, gently stretch the chilled dough into a 12-inch circle, using your fingertips and knuckles. Don't worry about it being perfect!</li>
        <li>Transfer to baking surface: Carefully transfer the stretched dough to your baking stone or preheated tray dusted with semolina or cornmeal.</li>
        <li>Top the pizza: Spread a thin layer of sauce over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge. Top with mozzarella cheese and drizzle with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Bake: Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Rotate the pizza halfway through for even baking.</li>
        <li>Finishing touches: Remove from the oven and top with fresh basil leaves and/or Parmesan cheese, if desired. Slice and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Tips</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>For a crispier crust, preheat your baking stone or tray as hot as possible.</li>
        <li>Don't overload the pizza with toppings - it can make the crust soggy.</li>
        <li>Experiment with different flours for the dough, such as whole wheat or spelt, for added flavour and texture.</li>
        <li>Use a pizza peel for easier transferring to and from the oven, if you have one.</li>
        <li>Leftover pizza can be reheated in the oven or toaster oven for a quick and delicious snack.</li>
    </ul>
