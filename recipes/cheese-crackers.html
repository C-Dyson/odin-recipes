  <h4>The Essential Ingredients:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>**Cheese:** Select 3-5 cheeses with contrasting flavors and textures (e.g., creamy brie, sharp cheddar, tangy goat cheese, bold blue cheese).</li>
    <li>**Crackers:** Explore different options like buttery classics, whole-wheat varieties, or crisp flatbreads to complement the cheeses.</li>
    <li>**Fruits:** Fresh grapes, figs, berries, or dried fruits like apricots and cranberries add sweetness and acidity.</li>
    <li>**Nuts and seeds:** Almonds, walnuts, pistachios, or a mix provide a satisfying crunch and texture.</li>
    <li>**Olives and pickles:** Offer a salty, briny element for balance.</li>
    <li>**Honey and jams:** Enhance sweetness and pair well with specific cheeses.</li>
    <li>**Wine (optional):** Choose a wine that complements the dominant flavors of your cheese selection (e.g., red for robust cheeses, white for milder options).</li>
